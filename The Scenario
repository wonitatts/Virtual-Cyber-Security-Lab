Contracted to Morgan Maxwell Real Estate to overhaul their IT infrastructure and systems

Currently have 50 staff connected to a workgroup network, no central file shares or storage, no backups, no monitoring or AV, no user management. 

Mr Maxwell, the Principle Agent, has become concerned about this and has requested that we centralize his IT resources, data and user management, so he has better control of his resources

He is also concerned about cyber security and has read a lot about Ransomware, and wants us to harden, monitor and defend his network.
