Virtual Servers. We will have:  
Email Server
Windows Server for AD/DC/DNS
Ubuntu Server to test hacking with
Elastic Monitoring for monitoring systems, info gathering in logs using the dashboards it offers

For Firewalls:
Install Opensense Next Gen firewall and installing features

For Virtual Clients
Windows 10 Client
Kali attack machine will be connected to this also. 

All will be connected using a Virtual L2 Switch also but all connections will be configured via DHCP because
of the headache that comes with a virtual static IP Address. Just keep note of any ip address changes. 
(ifconfig was my friend here :) )
