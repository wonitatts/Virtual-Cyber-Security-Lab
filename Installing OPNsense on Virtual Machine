First, navigate to this webpage to view the recommended specs that OPNsense offers. https://opnsense.org/users/get-started/

Second, after reviewing specs, click the download section to navigate to the opnsense iso file. 

Choose the dvd image and pick the closest mirror to where you are. Should only be amd64. 


While downloading. Head to the bzip 2 website here(or you can use 7zip like i did). https://opnsense.org/users/get-started/
Bzip to is a file extractor. Make sure to download the setup file at the top beginning with "complete package" if you're using windows.
An alternative is if you have WSL installed, you can boot up a ubuntu and use the bzip utility that's there. 

After bzip is downloaded and installed, make sure to take note of where the file location is. This will make setup and installation of opensense easier when navigating the terminal

Install the image like you normally would an iso onto vmware. Since this is a virtual environment, I used DHCP to lock in the ipaddress since I did not have one configured of my own.
