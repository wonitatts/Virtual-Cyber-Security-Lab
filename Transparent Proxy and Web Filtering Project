Overview
This project demonstrates how I configured a transparent proxy using OPNsense and Squid Proxy to manage and monitor HTTP traffic on a network. The setup includes redirecting all HTTP traffic (port 80) through the proxy server, enabling caching, and applying web filtering rules to control internet access.

Skills Gained
Network Traffic Management: Configured a transparent proxy to redirect and monitor HTTP traffic without manual client configuration.
Firewall and NAT Rules: Created advanced NAT and firewall rules to redirect traffic to the proxy.
Web Filtering: Applied access controls to block or allow specific websites/domains based on policies.
Performance Optimization: Enabled caching to improve browsing speed and reduce bandwidth usage.
Troubleshooting: Tested and resolved configuration issues to ensure seamless traffic redirection.
Hands-On OPNsense Experience: Navigated and configured the OPNsense firewall platform.

Tools and Technologies
OPNsense Firewall: Open-source firewall for traffic management.
Squid Proxy: Proxy server used for caching and web filtering.
NAT (Network Address Translation): Redirected HTTP traffic using NAT rules.

Steps Completed
Installed and Configured Squid Proxy:
Set up Squid Proxy in OPNsense for HTTP traffic filtering and caching.
Created Firewall and NAT Rules:
Redirected all HTTP (port 80) traffic to the Squid Proxy transparently.
Implemented Web Filtering:
Added access control rules to block or allow specific websites.
Tested the Configuration:
Validated that traffic redirection and filtering policies were working as intended.

Use Case
This setup is ideal for:

Monitoring and managing network traffic in small to medium-sized environments.
Enforcing internet usage policies.
Optimizing bandwidth usage with caching.
