This project will help you learn how to scan your network and systems for weaknesses, just like a hacker would, so you can fix them before someone else finds them.

Goal: Perform a vulnerability scan and analyze the results to identify potential security risks on your systems.

Step 1: Install a Vulnerability Scanner on Kali Linux
We’ll use a tool called OpenVAS (or Nessus if you prefer) to scan your systems for vulnerabilities.

Install OpenVAS:

Open a terminal in Kali Linux.
Run the following commands to install OpenVAS:
arduino
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openvas
sudo gvm-setup
After installation, you’ll need to run the setup command gvm-setup, which will configure the scanner.
This process might take some time, so be patient!
Start OpenVAS:

After setup, you can start the OpenVAS service by running:
sql
Copy
Edit
sudo gvm-start
Open your web browser and go to https://<Kali_IP>:9392 to access the OpenVAS web interface.
Log in using the username and password created during setup.
Step 2: Perform a Vulnerability Scan
Now that OpenVAS is ready, let’s scan your systems for vulnerabilities.

Create a New Target:

In the OpenVAS web interface, click on "Scans" and then "Tasks".
Click "New Task" to create a new scan.
Name the task something like "Scan Ubuntu Server".
Set the Target to the IP address of your Ubuntu Server (e.g., 192.168.20.2).
Choose the Scan Config to be Full and Fast (this is a general scan that looks for a lot of common vulnerabilities).
Run the Scan:

Click Save and then Start the scan.
OpenVAS will start scanning the Ubuntu Server for vulnerabilities.
This can take a few minutes, depending on the size of the system and the number of vulnerabilities it checks for.
Step 3: Analyze the Results
Once the scan is complete, you’ll see a list of vulnerabilities.

Review Vulnerabilities:

OpenVAS will show you different types of vulnerabilities with a severity rating (Low, Medium, High, Critical).
For each vulnerability, it will give you a description of what’s wrong, why it’s a problem, and how to fix it.
Focus on Critical and High Vulnerabilities:

Look at the Critical and High severity vulnerabilities first.
Check if any of them are related to things like:
Unpatched software.
Weak passwords.
Open ports that shouldn’t be open.
Step 4: Fix the Vulnerabilities
Once you know what’s wrong, it’s time to fix the issues.

Patch Software:

If the scan shows outdated software, update it using the package manager.
For Ubuntu, run:
sql
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
For Windows Server, check for any pending updates and install them.
Change Weak Passwords:

If OpenVAS finds weak passwords (like “admin” or “password123”), change them to something stronger. Use a mix of upper/lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
Close Unnecessary Ports:

If OpenVAS detects open ports that shouldn’t be open, you can close them by:
Adjusting firewall rules in OPNsense.
Disabling unnecessary services on the server.
Harden Configurations:

OpenVAS might also point out misconfigurations, like weak SSL/TLS settings or improper file permissions.
You can harden these by following the recommendations in the OpenVAS report.
Step 5: Re-Scan to Verify Fixes
After making changes, run another scan to verify that the vulnerabilities were fixed.

Re-run the Scan:
Go back to OpenVAS, and run the same scan again.
Check the results to see if the critical vulnerabilities are gone.
If new issues appear, repeat the process of fixing them.
Step 6: Document Findings
It’s important to document the vulnerabilities you found, how you fixed them, and any remaining issues.

Create a Report:
OpenVAS allows you to export the scan results as a PDF or HTML report.
Save the report for future reference or to share with others (like team members or managers).
